- **Description:** Visually organize pre-cached papers (scraped from Google Scholar) and queried research papers into a 3D space.
- **Details:**
  - Papers are represented as dots.
  - Dot positions are determined by quantifiable attributes (year published, citation count, paper length, bibliography length) mapped to the three axes.
  - Dot color and size indicate qualitative attributes like topic, field of study, or publication type.

#### 1.2 Metadata-based Paper Filtering
- **Description:** Filter papers based on various attributes and metadata in the viewport.
- **Details:**
  - Support multiple filtering conditions simultaneously.
  - Limit the number of visible papers to prevent visual clutter and maintain web performance.

#### 1.3 Attribute Representation Customization

  - Interaction highlights linked papers (via citations) with colored lines.
  - A slider bar adjusts the number of citation layers (children and parents) visualized.

#### 1.5 Paper Details Side Panel
- **Description:** Display a side panel when a paper is clicked.
- **Details:**
  - Show comprehensive metadata stored in the database.
  - Include parent and child linkages for the selected paper.
